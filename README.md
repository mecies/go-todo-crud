# Todo CRUD REST API üìù

This project is a simple RESTful CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing todos. It provides basic operations to interact with a todo list, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete todo items.

I built this project to get started with Go.

1. **Get all todos**
   - Endpoint: `GET /todo`
   - Description: Retrieve a list of all todos.

2. **Create a new todo**
   - Endpoint: `POST /todo`

     - Description (string): A description of the todo.
     - Completed (boolean): Indicates whether the todo is completed.
     - ID (number): Unique identifier for the todo.
   - Description: Create a new todo with the provided information.

3. **Update a todo by ID**
   - Endpoint: `PUT /todo/{id}`
